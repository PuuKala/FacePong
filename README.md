# FacePong
Pong game controlled by face position

## Dependencies
The game requires Python Turtle and OpenCV. You can install these through pip with commands:

and
> pip install opencv

**Most of the game side code taken from [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6jJg9Zan7w).**

The face positioning code used is taken from [my other repo](https://github.com/PuuKala/OpenCV_practice/tree/master/Python/FaceTrackingDemo).
